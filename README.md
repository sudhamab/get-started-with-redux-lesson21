# get-started-with-redux-lesson19
This is based on the lessons from https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux, lesson 19,
so one can look at how the running code looks like. It will get more complicated with subsequent 
lessons

The motivation for coming up with these repos was that I wanted to put document step by step 
how the code evolved to get more comfortable with thinking in Redux.

The last 6 or 7 lessons seemed to become a bit harder unless you coded along with it. 

So I decided to just follow the videos and create working versions of the entire code from Dan's lessons,
but backtracked from the 17th lesson onwards. 

To run the code, you can type 

npm install

and then 

npm start 

Lastly, you will see different versions of the index.js files, with a time stamp corresponding to the 
points beyond which the code was refactored. 

Have also added some comments of my own observations about the coding style as well as based on the 
lecture videos.
